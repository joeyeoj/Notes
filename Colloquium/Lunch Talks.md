Abstract:
The highly ionized warm/hot intergalactic medium (WHIM) permeating the vast space of the cosmic filaments is one of the least explored baryon contents in the local Universe. The properties of the WHIM in long cosmic filaments with lengths reaching up to 20-100Mpc, which account for >80% of the total filament volume and 50% of the baryonic mass, remain to be explored. In this work, we examine the emission properties of the WHIM in long cosmic filaments using the deepest SRG/eROSITA All-Sky Survey data available. By stacking the X-ray emission from 8000 cosmic filaments traced by the galaxy distribution by the SDSS, we detect the X-ray emission in the filament. After correcting for the emission from the unresolved point sources and extended low-mass haloes, the detection of the WHIM component remains statistically significant. We further stack the eROSITA X-ray spectra and obtain the first-ever broadband 100 eV resolution spectrum of cosmic filaments at the source frame. The best-fit mean gas temperature of the WHIM component is 10^6.8 K.

Illuminating the Cosmic Web and the Circumgalactic Medium with the help of quasars
"low" halo mass with various redshift z -- Ly \alpha
Lyalpha and HeII are similar, which make Lyalpha can trace kinematics. It is once considered untraceable to kinematics.
MUSE traces the largest filaments
4\times 4 MUSE traces the cosmic web
ALMA: large overdensity of CO(4-3)
Chandra: even larger overdensity
JWST & HST: galaxy morphologies, disk companion detected (dusty SF disk), redshift z=3.2

z~3.2, a giant, massive disk galaxy

Lyalpha, Halpha and HeII-Halpha observations require a multiphase CGM with broad density distribution / high turbulence (as "turbulent" as the ISM).
Associated with filamentsw with galaxy / AGN overdensity at z>3.
