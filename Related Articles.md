tidal interaction / stellar bar induce a star burst occurred ~10$^7$yr ago (Reference, introduction 第一段)
$\downarrow$
concentrate a substantial amount of gas, which is prerequisite fro starburst

unknown: the exact mechanisms of the onset and the turnoff of a starburst
##### Bregman, et al, 1995, ApJ
A question: whether the extend X-ray emission is consistent with a freely expanding flow, or if it results from an interaction with colder halo gas.
freely expansion model: 
the density will decrease as r$^{-2}$ (mass flux conservation, r is the distance along the jet.)
$\downarrow$
the projected surface brightness of the jet will decrease as g(N$_{\rm H}$)f(T)r$^{-3}$
$\downarrow$
the only losses are adiabatic, there is a constant conserved mass flux along the jet
the model with partial confinement:
the surface brightness of the X-ray emission is proportional to g(N$_{\rm H}$)f(T)(r$\theta)^{-3}$(r$\theta$ is the width of the jet perpendicular to the jet axis.)
